# Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange

The Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange project provides a beginner's approach to utilizing the Diffie-Hellman key agreement protocol. The project includes a Jupyter notebook file that demonstrates the following functionalities:

- Generation of parameters for generating keys, including private and public keys.
- The agent "Alice" generates a private key (x) and the corresponding public key (a^x), which is then sent to the other agent.
- The agent "Bob" follows the same process, generating a private key and a corresponding public key.

Additionally, the project incorporates the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA), a digital signature method that utilizes cryptography based on elliptic curves. Unlike traditional public key algorithms such as RSA, which employ multi-bit keys, ECC-based cryptographic systems offer the advantage of using smaller keys while maintaining the same level of security. This results in more agile algorithms that require less storage space, making them well-suited for devices with limited resources.

## Installation and Setup

To run the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed on your machine. You can install Jupyter using pip or Anaconda.

2. Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook and navigate to the directory where you saved the project files.

4. Open the Jupyter notebook file named "Diffie_Hellman_Key_Exchange.ipynb".

5. Follow the instructions and run the notebook cells to execute the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange demonstration.

For more detailed installation and setup instructions, please refer to the project documentation.

## Usage

Once you have set up the project and launched the Jupyter notebook, follow these steps to perform the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange:

1. Run the initial code cells to generate the required parameters for key generation.

2. Run the code cells for the agent "Alice" to generate her private key (x) and the corresponding public key (a^x).

3. Run the code cells for the agent "Bob" to generate his private key and public key.

4. The notebook will display the generated keys for both agents, showcasing the key exchange process.

5. Review the output and analyze the exchanged keys for both agents.

For more detailed usage instructions, please consult the provided Jupyter notebook and accompanying code comments.
