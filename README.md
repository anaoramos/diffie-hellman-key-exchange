# Diffie Hellman Key Exchange

There is an begginer approach to use the Diffie-Hellman key agreement protocol. There is a Jupyter notebook file that does the following:

1. Generation of parameters for generating the keys (private and public).
2. The agent Alice generates the private key, x, and the corresponding public key, a^x, (send to the other agent) and the agent
Bob does the same.

The **Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm**(ECDSA) method  is a digital signature method of documents with cryptography based on elliptic curves. The traditional public key algorithms (like RSA) and the digital signature that use this algorithms (like DSA) use multi-bit keys.
The use of **Elliptic curve cryptography**(ECC) based cryptographic systems has the advantage of use smaller keys with the same security level. With smaller keys size, the algorithms are more agile, use less storage space, which is indicated for devices with few resources.
